Background:
Hey guys. I wanted to share a mini-project i am working on. The main goal is to learn how to use Google sheets. After brainstorming many ideas i decided on one.
The plan was simple. I will compare monthly purchases of bags of sachet water versus bottled water for a dispenser. Initially we wanted to compare three types of packages. We planned to buy only bags of sachet water for this month, and then bottled water the next month and then finally a large bottle water for the dispenser the following month.
However we agreed bottled water was necessary incase we had visitors throughout the experiment.

Posting this especially at the beginning will encourage me to see it through till the end and complete the 'Monthly expense' sheet dashboard. I will try and make sure I send updates at the end of the month. Feel free to comment below if you have any suggestions.

You can follow the link to the google sheets below to keep track of your own water expenses or modify it as you please.

Research Question
Would we save more money in a month by only buying large bottled water for a dispenser along with bags of bottled water over bags of sachet water along with bottled water ?



Hypothesis 
A bag of sachet water is relatively cheaper than a bottled water dispenser. However we can only find out the answer by determining our monthly expense projection for both items.



Executive Summary
The research question asks whether buying bottled water for a dispenser would result in more savings. The hypothesis suggests that sachet water is cheaper than a bottled water dispenser. The goal is to calculate the monthly expense projection for both options to determine the answer.

The study does not track water consumption but focuses on purchase frequency. Factors such as water wastage or spills are not considered. The frequency of purchasing medium-sized bottled water can influence the expense projection for both dispenser water and sachet water, Hence the main decision will be based on the total expenditure. Bottled water + Bottled Dispenser water versus Bottled Water + Sachet Water). Also I acknogledge that the type of packaging of water (bottle, sachet) can influence the rate of water consumption for the household. We will put measures in place to calculate its influence in later studies.
